Given an input string, reverse the string word by word.
Example:
Input:  
["t","h","e"," ","s","k","y"," ","i","s"," ","b","l","u","e"]
â€‹
Output: 
["b","l","u","e"," ","i","s"," ","s","k","y"," ","t","h","e"]
Note: 
A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters.
The input string does not contain leading or trailing spaces.
The words are always separated by a single space.
Follow up: Could you do itin-placewithout allocating extra space?
