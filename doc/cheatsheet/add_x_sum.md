# Add `xxx` to Sum

- https://leetcode.com/problems/add-strings/solution/

`Facebook` interviewers like this question and propose it in four main variations. The choice of algorithm should be based on the input format:

1. Strings (the current problem). Use schoolbook digit-by-digit addition. Note, that to fit into constant space is not possible for languages with immutable strings, for example, for Java and Python. Here are two examples:
- LC 067 : Add Binary: sum two binary strings.
- LC 415 : Add Strings: sum two non-negative numbers in a string representation without converting them to integers directly.

2. Integers. Usually, the interviewer would ask you to implement a sum without using + and - operators. Use bit manipulation approach. Here is an example:
- LC 371 : Sum of Two Integers: Sum two integers without using + and - operators.

3. Arrays. The same textbook addition. Here is an example:
- LC 989 : Add to Array Form of Integer.

4. Linked Lists. Sentinel Head + Textbook Addition. Here are some examples:
- LC 66 : Plus One.
- LC 002 : Add Two Numbers.
- LC 445 : Add Two Numbers II.
