 * 853. Car Fleet
 * Solved
 * Medium
 * Topics
 * Companies
 * There are n cars at given miles away from the starting mile 0, traveling to reach the mile target.
 *
 * You are given two integer array position and speed, both of length n, where position[i] is the starting mile of the ith car and speed[i] is the speed of the ith car in miles per hour.
 *
 * A car cannot pass another car, but it can catch up and then travel next to it at the speed of the slower car.
 *
 * A car fleet is a car or cars driving next to each other. The speed of the car fleet is the minimum speed of any car in the fleet.
 *
 * If a car catches up to a car fleet at the mile target, it will still be considered as part of the car fleet.
 *
 * Return the number of car fleets that will arrive at the destination.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: target = 12, position = [10,8,0,5,3], speed = [2,4,1,1,3]
 *
 * Output: 3
 *
 * Explanation:
 *
 * The cars starting at 10 (speed 2) and 8 (speed 4) become a fleet, meeting each other at 12. The fleet forms at target.
 * The car starting at 0 (speed 1) does not catch up to any other car, so it is a fleet by itself.
 * The cars starting at 5 (speed 1) and 3 (speed 3) become a fleet, meeting each other at 6. The fleet moves at speed 1 until it reaches target.
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: target = 10, position = [3], speed = [3]
 *
 * Output: 1
 *
 * Explanation:
 *
 * There is only one car, hence there is only one fleet.
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: target = 100, position = [0,2,4], speed = [4,2,1]
 *
 * Output: 1
 *
 * Explanation:
 *
 * The cars starting at 0 (speed 4) and 2 (speed 2) become a fleet, meeting each other at 4. The car starting at 4 (speed 1) travels to 5.
 * Then, the fleet at 4 (speed 2) and the car at position 5 (speed 1) become one fleet, meeting each other at 6. The fleet moves at speed 1 until it reaches target.
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * n == position.length == speed.length
 * 1 <= n <= 105
 * 0 < target <= 106
 * 0 <= position[i] < target
 * All the values of position are unique.
 * 0 < speed[i] <= 106
 *

    /**
     * IDEA :
     *
     * The approach involves sorting the cars by their starting positions
     * (from farthest to nearest to the target)
     * and computing their time to reach the target.
     * We then iterate through these times to count the number of distinct fleets.
     *
     *   NOTE !!! concept of `arrived time` (time = (target - position) / speed)
     *   NOTE !!! how we append new fleet
     *
     *
     *
     * Steps in the Code:
     * 	1.	Pair Cars with Their Speeds:
     * 	    •	Combine position and speed into a 2D array cars for easier sorting and access.
     * 	2.	Sort Cars by Position Descending:
     * 	    •	Use Arrays.sort with a custom comparator to sort cars from farthest to nearest relative to the target.
     * 	3.	Calculate Arrival Times:
     * 	    •	Compute the time each car takes to reach the target using the formula:
     *
     *  time = (target - position) / speed
     *
     * 	4.	Count Fleets:
     * 	    •	Iterate through the times array:
     * 	    •	If the current car’s arrival time is greater than the lastTime (time of the last fleet), it forms a new fleet.
     * 	    •	Update lastTime to the current car’s time.
     * 	5.	Return Fleet Count:
     * 	    •	The number of distinct times that exceed lastTime corresponds to the number of fleets.
