/**
 * 986. Interval List Intersections
 * Medium
 * Topics
 * Companies
 * You are given two lists of closed intervals, firstList and secondList, where firstList[i] = [starti, endi] and secondList[j] = [startj, endj]. Each list of intervals is pairwise disjoint and in sorted order.
 *
 * Return the intersection of these two interval lists.
 *
 * A closed interval [a, b] (with a <= b) denotes the set of real numbers x with a <= x <= b.
 *
 * The intersection of two closed intervals is a set of real numbers that are either empty or represented as a closed interval. For example, the intersection of [1, 3] and [2, 4] is [2, 3].
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: firstList = [[0,2],[5,10],[13,23],[24,25]], secondList = [[1,5],[8,12],[15,24],[25,26]]
 * Output: [[1,2],[5,5],[8,10],[15,23],[24,24],[25,25]]
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: firstList = [[1,3],[5,9]], secondList = []
 * Output: []
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 0 <= firstList.length, secondList.length <= 1000
 * firstList.length + secondList.length >= 1
 * 0 <= starti < endi <= 109
 * endi < starti+1
 * 0 <= startj < endj <= 109
 * endj < startj+1

                 *
                 *
                 * The logic for moving the pointers is based on the
                 * idea of always advancing to the next potential overlap in
                 * the list that ends first. Here's the reasoning behind it:
                 *
                 *
                 * Given two intervals:
                 *
                 * firstVal = [start1, end1] from firstList
                 * secondVal = [start2, end2] from secondList
                 *
                 *
                 * -> We compare end1 and end2 (the end times of both intervals):
                 *
                 * -> If end1 < end2:
                 *     This means that the interval in firstList ends earlier
                 *     than the interval in secondList. So, we increment
                 *     the pointer i to move to the next interval in firstList
                 *     because the current interval from firstList is finished,
                 *     and no further intersections with the current interval from secondList can happen.
                 *
                 * -> If end1 >= end2:
                 *     This means that the interval in secondList ends earlier
                 *     (or at the same time as the firstList interval).
                 *     Therefore, we increment the pointer j to move to the next interval in secondList,
                 *     because the current interval from secondList is finished,
                 *     and no further intersections with the current interval from firstList can happen.

       * 	2.	active:

       * 	   - When two intervals overlap, active will equal 2 during the overlap.
