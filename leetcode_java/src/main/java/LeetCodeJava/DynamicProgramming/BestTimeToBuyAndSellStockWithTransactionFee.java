 * 714. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Transaction Fee
 * Medium
 * Topics
 * Companies
 * Hint
 * You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day, and an integer fee representing a transaction fee.
 *
 * Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions as you like, but you need to pay the transaction fee for each transaction.
 *
 * Note:
 *
 * You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).
 * The transaction fee is only charged once for each stock purchase and sale.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: prices = [1,3,2,8,4,9], fee = 2
 * Output: 8
 * Explanation: The maximum profit can be achieved by:
 * - Buying at prices[0] = 1
 * - Selling at prices[3] = 8
 * - Buying at prices[4] = 4
 * - Selling at prices[5] = 9
 * The total profit is ((8 - 1) - 2) + ((9 - 4) - 2) = 8.
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: prices = [1,3,7,5,10,3], fee = 3
 * Output: 6
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 1 <= prices.length <= 5 * 104
 * 1 <= prices[i] < 5 * 104
 * 0 <= fee < 5 * 104

  /**
   * Solution Explanation:
   *
   *
   *  -  Use two variables to represent the state:
   * 	  1. hold: The maximum profit achievable
   * 	           while holding a stock at day i.
   *
   * 	  2. cash: The maximum profit achievable
   * 	           while not holding a stock at day i.
   *
   *  - Transition equations:
   * 	- If holding a stock:
   *       hold = max(hold, cash - price[i])
   *
   *       NOTE: 2 cases we hold th stock: 1) already hold from previous day 2) buy a new stock today
   *       (`hold`: You already held the stock from a previous day -> If you decided not to make any changes today, then the profit remains the same as the previous hold.)
   *       (`cash - price[i]`: You buy the stock today -> To buy the stock today, you need to spend money, reducing your profit. The cost to buy the stock is prices[i]. However, the amount of money you can spend is the maximum profit you had when you were not holding a stock previously (cash).)
   *
   * (You either keep holding or buy a new stock.)
   * 	- If not holding a stock:
   *       cash = max(cash, hold + price[i] - fee)
   *
   *
   * (You either keep not holding or sell the stock and pay the fee.)
   * 	- Initialize:
   * 	   - hold = -prices[0] (If you buy the stock on the first day).
   * 	   -  cash = 0 (You haven’t made any transactions yet).
   *

  /**
   *  Example Walkthrough:
   *
   * Input:
   * 	•	Prices: [1, 3, 2, 8, 4, 9]
   * 	•	Fee: 2
   *
   * Steps:
   * 	1.	Day 0:
   * 	•	hold = -1 (Buy the stock at price 1).
   * 	•	cash = 0.
   * 	2.	Day 1:
   * 	•	cash = max(0, -1 + 3 - 2) = 0 (No selling since profit is 0).
   * 	•	hold = max(-1, 0 - 3) = -1 (No buying since it’s already better to hold).
   * 	3.	Day 2:
   * 	•	cash = max(0, -1 + 2 - 2) = 0.
   * 	•	hold = max(-1, 0 - 2) = -1.
   * 	4.	Day 3:
   * 	•	cash = max(0, -1 + 8 - 2) = 5 (Sell at price 8).
   * 	•	hold = max(-1, 5 - 8) = -1.
   * 	5.	Day 4:
   * 	•	cash = max(5, -1 + 4 - 2) = 5.
   * 	•	hold = max(-1, 5 - 4) = 1.
   * 	6.	Day 5:
   * 	•	cash = max(5, 1 + 9 - 2) = 8 (Sell at price 9).
   * 	•	hold = max(1, 5 - 9) = 1.
   *
   * Output:
   * 	•	cash = 8 (Max profit).
