/**
 * 871. Minimum Number of Refueling Stops Hard Topics Companies A car travels from a starting
 * position to a destination which is target miles east of the starting position.
 *
 * <p>There are gas stations along the way. The gas stations are represented as an array stations
 * where stations[i] = [positioni, fueli] indicates that the ith gas station is positioni miles east
 * of the starting position and has fueli liters of gas.
 *
 * <p>The car starts with an infinite tank of gas, which initially has startFuel liters of fuel in
 * it. It uses one liter of gas per one mile that it drives. When the car reaches a gas station, it
 * may stop and refuel, transferring all the gas from the station into the car.
 *
 * <p>Return the minimum number of refueling stops the car must make in order to reach its
 * destination. If it cannot reach the destination, return -1.
 *
 * <p>Note that if the car reaches a gas station with 0 fuel left, the car can still refuel there.
 * If the car reaches the destination with 0 fuel left, it is still considered to have arrived.
 *
 * <p>Example 1:
 *
 * <p>Input: target = 1, startFuel = 1, stations = [] Output: 0 Explanation: We can reach the target
 * without refueling. Example 2:
 *
 * <p>Input: target = 100, startFuel = 1, stations = [[10,100]] Output: -1 Explanation: We can not
 * reach the target (or even the first gas station). Example 3:
 *
 * <p>Input: target = 100, startFuel = 10, stations = [[10,60],[20,30],[30,30],[60,40]] Output: 2
 * Explanation: We start with 10 liters of fuel. We drive to position 10, expending 10 liters of
 * fuel. We refuel from 0 liters to 60 liters of gas. Then, we drive from position 10 to position 60
 * (expending 50 liters of fuel), and refuel from 10 liters to 50 liters of gas. We then drive to
 * and reach the target. We made 2 refueling stops along the way, so we return 2.
 *
 * <p>Constraints:
 *
 * <p>1 <= target, startFuel <= 109 0 <= stations.length <= 500 1 <= positioni < positioni+1 <
 * target 1 <= fueli < 109
