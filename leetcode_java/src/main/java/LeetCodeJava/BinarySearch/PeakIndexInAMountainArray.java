/**
 * 852. Peak Index in a Mountain Array
 * Solved
 * Medium
 * Topics
 * Companies
 * You are given an integer mountain array arr of length n where the values increase to a peak element and then decrease.
 *
 * Return the index of the peak element.
 *
 * Your task is to solve it in O(log(n)) time complexity.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: arr = [0,1,0]
 *
 * Output: 1
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: arr = [0,2,1,0]
 *
 * Output: 1
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: arr = [0,10,5,2]
 *
 * Output: 1
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 3 <= arr.length <= 105
 * 0 <= arr[i] <= 106
 * arr is guaranteed to be a mountain array.
